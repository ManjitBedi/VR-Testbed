# VR-Testbed

Here we go, making VR test scenes & experiments using the XR Interaction toolkit with openXR; I am focusing on getting it working with the HTC Vive and Steam VR at the moment.

As new experiments are added, I shall add new scenes...

This project contains assets from various sources like Unity; theses assets are subject to the licensing agreements of the orginal providers of said assets.

This code is rough & not quite ready; use at your own caution ...
